## Negative Imperfect Tense

In English, the negative past tense works loosely as follows;

> I went to the railway station.

Is the opposite of;

> I did not go to the railway station.

And in Finnish, this is pretty straightforward.

### with verb types 1 and 2

With the verb asua - meaning to live. The present tense sentence:

> Minä asun Helsingissä

Might become, in the imperfect tense:

> Minä asuin Helsingissä

Then the opposite would be:

> (Minä) en asunut Helsingissä

Verb type 1 and 2 verbs can be created using the body (remove the last letter,
in verb type 1 and the last two letters in verb type two) and either -nyt/-nut 
for singular and -neet for plural.

> Me emme asuneet Helsingissä

### with verb type 3

These are found with the body (remove the last two letters). Add the correct
choice of nut/nyt, lut/lyt, sut/syt, rut/ryt so that the last letter ends up
doubled. Also, with a plural person (me/te/he), neet, reet, leet or seet may be
used.

For example, with the verb tulla, which has the body tul-, lut is added, making
the singular form en tullut. 

### with verb types 4, 5 and 6

These are very similar to verb type 2. The body is found by removing the last
two letters, then, either nnut/nnyt for singular or nneet for plural are added.

For example, the verb osata has the body osa, so becomes En osannut, in the minä
form.

## The Fourth Infinitive

### Making it

The -minen form is the "fourth infinitive". It has a similar effect to adding
-ing to a verb in English, to get forms like "swimming" and "writing".

To find it, start with the body, in the strong form. The easiest way to find
this is to start with the -vat form of the verb, then remove the -vat to get the
strong body.

Then, add -minen to this body.

### Using it

### When the object becomes genetive

In some sentences, the object has to become genetive:

| Mina | soitan | kitaraa    |
|------|--------|------------|
| I    | play   | the guitar |
| Subject | Verb | Object    |

In this sentence, the subject is partitive, which is usually the case;

| Minun | uusi | harrastus | on | kitaran | soittaminen |
|-------|------|-----------|----|---------|-------------|
| My    | new  | hobby     | is | guitar  | playing     |
|       |      | subject   | verb | object |  | 

Here, kitaraa (partitive) becomes kitaran (genitive), so the verb that follows
it becomes substantive.

### When there's no genitive

When the new sentence doesn't include a genitive, the verb becomes substantive.
For example:

> He saunovat mokillä

Is a simple action, but, if itäs used in a sentence with another verb, it could
become:

> He rakastavat mökillä saunomista.

As the verb is now the rakastavat, so the subject no longer needs the genetive
form.

Note that the -minen form can take endings which make it -mista, in this
example.

### With a partitive adjective

This is a little like English, instead of saying:

> To read is pleasant

You would say

> Reading is pleasant.

So in Finnish, you would write:

> Lukeminen on mukavaa.

Note that the adjective is partitive here.
