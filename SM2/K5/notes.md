## Perfect Tenses

In English, these are used where you say something in the present tense that
describes the past, like:

> I have worked in a hosptial.

### Positive

To create this, add the personal form of Olla to the body of the word, with the
-nut/-nyt suffix for singular and the -neet suffix for plural.

The verb ends up in the same form as the Negative Imperfect.

For example, I have eaten becomes:

> Olen syönyt

### Negative

The negative perfect tense forms, which, for example, might mean:

> I have not eaten.

Are formed using the negative person forms, followed by the body of the verb
Olla, ole, then the -nut/-nyt/-neet form.

For example;

> En ole syönyt.

## When to use the Perfect and Imperfect Tenses

### Imperfect

For example:

> Kävin Pariisissa viime vuonna.

Which translates as:

> I visited Paris last year.

#### When the event is over

If you're talking about an event that has already ended. 

So, I visited Paris, but now I've returned.

#### When the sentence says when

For example, if you're answering a question about when something happened, or
the sentence includes a specific mention of time.

> Liisa osti eilen auton

This sentence states that "Liisa bought a car yesterday". This is a clear
statement of the time the car was bought.

### Perfect

#### The Event Continues

For example;

> Olen asunut Suomessa jo 4 vuotta.

Means "I have lived in Finland for four years", "and I continue to" is implied.

#### When the sentence doesn't say when

For example;

> Liisa on ostanut auton

Liisa has bought a car, it doesn't mention when this was.

#### The thing could still happen later

In the English sentence:

> I've not eaten lunch yet.

I still could eat lunch, so it wouldn't make much sense to state "I didn't eat
lunch".

#### The outcome can be seen now

In the example:

> Maa on valkoinen. On satanut lunta.

The ground is white. It has snowed. 

Effectively we are talking about the status the ground is in now, because of
something that happened in the past.

#### When talking about an experience

In this example, in English, we could say I have visited the Eiffel Tower.o

#### When the sentence includes both present tense and perfect tense

For example, in English:

> When we have eaten, we wash the dishes.

The first half of the sentence needs to be in the perfect tense, and the second
clause in imperfect.

#### Sentences with specific words

When there are the words, they qualify times:

- jo - now
- joskus - sometimes
- silloin tälläin - from time to time
- usein - usually
- aina - always
- koko ikäni - in the whole life
- ei vielä - not yet
- ei koskaan - never
