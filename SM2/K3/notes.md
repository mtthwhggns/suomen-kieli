## Third Infinitive

### maan/mään

When there are two verbs together, for example, in English:

> I am going to a restaurant to eat 

The maan/mään suffix allows these to be combined. For example:

> Minä mennen ravintolaan syömään 

To make this form, take the strong grade form (the one for -vat/vät) and add
-maan/-mään depending on the vowel harmony.

This suffix also works with lähteä (to go), kävellä (to walk) and ajaa (to
drive).

### massa/mässä

This is made the same way, and works for present tense action forms. For
example:

> Kari is in the restaurant eating

Would be

> Kari on ravintolassa syämässä

The case endings need to match.

Some other eligible verbs are istua (to sit), seisoa (to stand) and käydä (to
visit).

### masta/mästä

This describes coming from doing something, so tulla (to come) is a good
example.

> She comes from eating at the restaurant.

Or, more, literally:

> She comes from the restaurant, from eating.

Would be:

> Hän tule ravintolasta syömästä.

Some other verbs for this example are palata (to return) and lähteä (to go).

## Transitive and Intransitive Verbs

- Transitive verbs always have an object, as well as a subject. Contrast, in
  English:
  - The man felled the tree
  - The tree fell
- In the first example, the man is the subject and the tree is the object,
  while, in the second, the tree is the subject, and there is no object.

Some more examples are;

Transitive                            | Intransitive
--------------------------------------|------------------------------------
Kataa (to be felled)                  | Kaatua (to fall)
Herätää (to be woken)                 | Herätä (to awaken)
Avata (to be opened)                  | Autea (to open)
Sulkea (to be closed)                 | Sulkeutua (to close)
Sytyttää (to be lit/ignited)            Syttyä (to ignite)
Sammutta (to extinguished)                 | Sammua (to go out)
Pudotta (to dropped)                 | Pudota (to fall)
Jatkaa (to continue)                 | Jatkua (to continue)
Jättää (to take)                 | Jäädä (to stay)

## Verb Type 6

Verb type 6 is quite uncommon. Words end e + ta/tä.

Only verbs which mean "to become something" are verb type 6. Other verbs are
verb type 4.

An example of a verb type 6 verb is Vanheta; to become older.

To find the body of the verb, replace the -ta/-tä with -ne.

Where there is a KPT change, all forms will use the strong grade.

The Hän form of the verb will always end with a long vowel, for example,
Vanhenee. 

Some other examples of these verbs are;

- Aueta - To become loose
- Kuumeta - To become hot
- Kylmeta - To get cold
- Lyhetä - To become shorter
- Nuroeta - To become younger
- Paeta - To run away
- Pidetä - To become longer
- Pienetä - To become smaller 
- Pimetä - To get dark
- Suureta - To get bigger 
- Tarjeta - To stand the cold
- Tyhjeta - To become empty
- Vaieta - To become silent
- Viiletä - To cool down
