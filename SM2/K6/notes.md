## Past Perfect Forms

The "past perfect" forms in English, for example;

> I was eating.

Make reference to something that happened (or did not happen) in the past, in
contrast to the perfect tense, which talks about something in the present that
is directly affected by something that happened in the past, for example;

> I have eaten.

In Finnish, these are called "pluskvamperfekti" form.

### Positive

These are formed by taking the past tense personal form of the verb olla, and
adding the sufficies -nyt/-nut for singular or -neet for plural persons.

So, from the first example, "I was eating" will become;

> Olin syönyt.

And "they were eating" becomes:

> Olivat syöneet.

### Negative

This is formed similarly, but with the negative personal form, followed by ollut
(for singular personals) and olleet (for plural persons), then the verb in the
same form as the positive.

For example, to say "I was not eating", you would say;

> En ollut syönyt.

And to say "we were not eating";

> Eivat olleet syöneet.

## Tense Usage

### Present

The present tense is used when;

- The thing is happening now. For example, "Kuuntelen musiikkia", "I'm listening
  to music".
- The statement is true now, and is always true. Like "Julia on romanialainen",
  "Julia is Romanian".
- Talking about the future, usually with an expression of time. Example "Soitan
  sinulle illalla", "I [will] call you in the evening".

### Imperfect

- Talking about the past
- Then the thing being described has finished. "Asiun Englanissa", "I lived in
  England."
- The sentence includes when

### Perfect

- Talking about the past.
- No statement about when something happened.
- When the thing being described continues.
- The thing could still happen later.
- When the outcome is being described or observed.
- When combining a statement about something that happened previously with the
  effect it has now. For example, "When you have finished your homework, you
  can play computer games.

### Past Perfect

- Talking about the past.
- When the thing being talked about has ended.
- When there is something in both past perfect and imperfect. For example, "I
  hadn't had dinner when I heard the news."

## Word Type Vus/Vys

Words ending with any vowel followed by us or ys can be made partitive by
removing the s and adding tta/ttä. The body is found removing the final s and
adding -de.

Some examples of words of this type are;

- Avaruus - Space
- Lapsuus - Childhood
- Salaisuus - Secret
- Sairaus - Sickness

## Possessive Suffices

When using a possessive person, like minun, sinun, heidan, or, in English, my,
your or their, an extra suffix should be added to the word.

These suffices are always added to the strong forms.

The suffices are added after any case endings.

If the word ends with -t or -n, this is always removed.

Adjectives do not have posessive suffices.
