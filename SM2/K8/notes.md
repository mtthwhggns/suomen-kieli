## Plural Genitives

## When to use Plural Partitive

### When a plural is the subject of the sentence

For example, in English:

> I buy apples for the children.

The apples are the subject.

### When saying what they are

If you are stating that some people or some things are something, this can be
done using plural partitives.

For example;

> Alex and Pedro are good students.

In Finnish, both the good and the students would be pluralised.

### When stating where something is

In these examples: 

> On the table are glasses

and:

> In Finland, there are no penguins.

The glasses and penguins are pluralised.

### Sentences involving having to do something

When saying that a specific group needs to do something, using "täytyy" or
"tarvitse", the group can be described using using plural genitive.

### When using a postposition

Some postpositions, like "kanssa" or "välissä" are preceeded by the thing they
are positioned around, in genitive form. If this thing is, for example, a group
of people, plural genitive should be used.

## Adjective Types

From the body of an adjective, we can make the comparative and superlative
forms.

### Comparative

For the adjective pieni, small, the body is piene-.

-mpi is added after the body to make the word "smaller".

One notable exception is hyvä, which has parempi, meaning better, paljon, which
has enemmän, meaning more than.

## Superlative

For the same adjective, removing the e (also a, ä), and adding in creates
"pienin", meaning "smallest".

One notable exception is hyvä, which has paras, meaning best, and paljon has eniten,
meaning "most".
