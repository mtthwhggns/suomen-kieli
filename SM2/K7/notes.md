## i-plurals

The plural form using an i can be used to form the plural partitive and plural
genitive forms.

For example, in English;

> The family live in a big house.

Can become;

> The families live in big houses.

In Finnish;

> Perheet asuu isossa talossa.

becomes;

> Perheet asuvat isoissa taloissa.

In this case, we use the simply -t form for the families, as we are talking
about specific families, not an undefined selection of families or all families.

The houses, on the other hand, are a few specific houses, so we use the i-plural
form, to give the effect of "some big houses".

### Creating the Plural Body

The plural body is found using the singular body, then:

- If the final letter is o, ö, u or y, it remains unchanged.
- If it ends with an a, ä or e, these are removed.

Then an i is added to the body.

- If it ends with ai, this becomes oi IF the first syllable contains i, e or a.
- If it ends with ii, this is replaced with i.
- If this includes two identical vowels, they are replaced with a single one.
- If it ends with uoi, this is replaced with oi.
- If it ends with yöi, this is replaced with öi.
- If it ends with iei, this is replaced with ei.

Words which end -si remain unchanged.

Words ending with a vowel, then -us or -ys have a body ending with -de. Once the
i is added, this becomes -ksi.

#### Long Words

In long words, a/ä becomes o/ö. 

- -la/-lä becomes -loi/-löi.
- -na/-nä becomes -noi/-nöi.
- -ra/-rä becomes -roi/-röi.
- -ija/-ijä becomes -joi/-jöi.
- -ia/-iä becomes -ioi/-iöi.
- -kka/-kkä becomes -koi/-köi.

### Plural Illatives

- If the plural body ends with an i, add in to form the illative.
- If the plural body ends with a two vowels together, add "hin" to form the
  illative.
- When the singular illative includes -seen, use siin to make the plural
  illative.

## "That"

The word joka means "that". It can replace a word in the second clause of a
sentence to refer to the thing in the first half.

If the thing in the first half is a plural, the word joka needs to be
pluralised.

The simple, t-form of the plural is "jotka". The partitive is joita, and the
plural body is joi-. It should always be written in the same form as the word it
"replaces".
