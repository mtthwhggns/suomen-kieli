## Passive Imperfect

### Use 

The passive imperfect is used like the passive, when there is something that
doesn't have a clear object (In Finland, Swedish was spoken).

### Formation

#### With Verb Type 1

- Take the weak stem (this is the minä vartalo)
- If the last letter is an a or ä, replace it with an e
- Add -ttiin (positive) or -ttu or -tty (negative)

For example, to say, "was spoken", we start with the body of the minä form 
(minä puhun), remove the n, (puhu) and add the (-ttiin), leaving us with
puhuttiin.

Likewise, the negative form would add ttu (vowel harmony) to the puhu stem,
giving "ei puhuttu".

#### With Verb Types 2 and 3

Here, we start with the infinitive body, and add -tiin (positive) or -tu or -ty
(negative), as appropriate.

For example, juoda (2) becomes juotiin (positive) and ei joutu (negative).

And kävellä (3), becomes käveltiin in positive, and ei kävelty (negative).

#### With Verb Types 4, 5 and 6

Here, we start again with the infinitive body, but this time we add -ttiin
(positive) or -ttu/-tty (negative).

For example, 
- tavata (4) becomes tavattiin (positive) or ei tavattu (negative).
- tarvita (5) becomes tarvittiin (positive) or ei tarvittu (negative)
- vaieta (6) becomes vaiettiin (positive) or ei vaiettu (negative).

## Passive Perfect

### Use

For example, "On syöty", is "has been eaten".

### Formation

#### With Verb Types 1, 4, 5 and 6

The passive stem is used.

This one can be found using the passive. For example, sanoa (1) has the passive
sanotaan. The stem is, therefore, sano.

Adding -ttu/-tty (dependant on vowel harmony) gives the passive perfect, so, in
this example, it is "on sanottu".

Adding "ei ole" in place of "on", returns the negative form.

#### With Verb Types 2 and 3

The steps are as above, however -tu and -ty are used in place of
-ttu/-tty.

## Passive Present Perfect

### Use

For example, "oli syöty", literally translates as "had been eaten". It might be 
used when talking about something that had happened to something.

### Formation

Use similar rules to above to find the verb and the correct suffix, however, the
verb is preceded with oli/ei ollut rather than on/ei ole.

## Transitive and Intransitive Verbs

As have been covered previously;

- *Transitive* verbs require an object
- *Intransitive* verbs do not need an object

Most verbs have both transitive and intransitive forms.

For example:

### Poistaa and Poistua

Poistaa is to remove - the guard removes the man

Poistua is to leave - the man leaves

The effect is the same (the man is now out), but the exact process is different.

### Aloittaa and Alkaa

Aloittaa is to commence - the performers commence performing at a certain time.

Alkaa is to start - the performance starts at a certain time.

### Kasvattaa and Kasvaa

Kasvattaa is to bring up or let grow - parents bring up their children

Kasvaa is to grow - trees grow on their own

### Kääntää and Kääntyä

Kääntaa is to turn or to steer - I turn the car to the left

Kääntyä is to turn or bear - The road bears to the left

### Lopettaa and Loppua

Lopettaa is to make something end, or bring it to a close

Loppua is when a thing comes to an end

### Päästää and Päästä

Päästää is to let go, the object is the thing being let go.

Päästä is for the thing to be able to go. 

### Päättää and Päättyä

Päättää is to end.

Päättyä is to end up somewhere.

### Siirtää and Siirtyä

These mean to move or relocate. 

Siirtää means that someone moves something (can refer to time too)

Siirtyä means that the thing moves (to another time).

## Kansi Word type

Words like kynsi, länsi, varsi and virsi are the "kansi" word type. The
partitive form of kansi is kantta, and the body (vartalo) is kanne-.

The only exceptions to the normal rules from the body are the illative form, 
which becomes kanteen, the plural (monikon), which becomes kannet, and the
plural stem (monikon vartalo), which returns to kansi.

## Ne menee 

There are a few phrases which occur specifically in spoken language;

| Written     | Spoken   |
|-------------|----------|
| he ovat     | ne on    |
| he syävöt   | ne syö   |
| he menevät  | ne menee |
| he pelaavat | ne pelaa |
