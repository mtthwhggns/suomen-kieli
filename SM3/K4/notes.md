## Te-person Imperative

The imperative turns a verb ("to read", "lukea" (1)) into a
command ("read!", "lue").

When dealing with groups of people a different form is used.

### Positive

Using the body of the word (how this is found depends on the verb type),
the positive form is created by adding kaa/kää.

For example, "lukea" (1) has the body of "luke". This becomes "lukekaa".

When dealing with type 4 verbs we need to keep an extra t, for example,
"pelata" (4) has the body of "pela", but becomes "pelatkaa".

### Negative

The negative form is found by taking the body of the word, then by
adding "ko/kö", and adding the word "Älkää" before the word.

For example, Syödä (2) becomes "Älkää syökö".

Again, a k sometimes appears (TODO: when). For example, valita (5)
becomes "Älkää valitko".

## Present Passive Conditional

### Mentäisiin

The "mentäisiin" form of menna literally means "we would go".

It is used in two specific contexts;

- "We would go" - first person plural, for example, to ask "would we go to
  Helsinki"
- "One would go" - to talk about what one would do, without the clarity about
  exactly who we are talking about.

#### Verb type 1

This can be found by taking the body of the minä form of the verb, and
suffixing it with "ttaisin" or "ttäisin".

If the body ends with an a or an ä, this is replaced with an e.

For example, annta (1) has the minä form of annan, which has the body of
anna. The final a is replaced with an e, and ttaisin is added, giving a
present passive conditional form of annettaisiin.

The negative is found simply by removing the final "in", and adding
the word "ei" before it.

#### Verb types 2 and 3

This form is found by starting with the infinitive body, then adding
taisiin/täisiin.

The negative form is found by removing the final "in", and adding the
word "ei" before the word.

#### Verb types 4, 5 and 6

These are found in the same way as verb types 2 and 3, except that
"ttaisiin/ttäisiin" are used (with an extra t) as the suffices.
