## Conditional 

In English, the conditional forms usually involve sentences with words like
"would" or "could".

> I wish I could fly.

In Finnish, these are formed by taking the strong stem of the word, the one
found from the "he" form of the verb, adding the conditional suffix, "isi", then
the personal ending.

Before adding the "isi", different things need to be done depending how the word
ends;

- If the word ends with vowels o, ö, u, y, a, ä, nothing needs to change.
- If the word ends with e or i, this is removed.
- If the word ends with two of the same vowel, they are replaced with one of
  that vowel.
- Yö becomes öi
- Uo becomes oi
- ie becomes ei

So, for the verb nukkua:

- The "he" form is he nukkuvat.
- The personal suffix is "n"
- The conditional form is nukkuisin.

Or for the verb lukea:

- The "he" form is lukevat.
- "Luke-" ends with an e, so becomes "luk"
- The personal suffix can be "-mme"
- The conditional form is lukisimme.

### Negative

The negative form can be made by conjugating only the negative verb, so that the
conditional always ends with -isi.

For example;

The negative "te" form of the verb "tehdä".

- The -vat form is tekivät.
- The conditional is tekisitte.
- The negative form would become "Emme tekisitte".

### Perfect

Here, simple add the isi into the olla verb, before the conjugation, then, add
nut/nyt/neet to the verb. 

For example, the verb ostaa in the "he" form.

Without the conditional, the perfect form would be "Olen ostanut". 

In the conditional form, the conditional suffix, "isi" is added to the Olla
verb, which becomes "Olisin", so "Olisin ostanut" translates to "I would have
bought".

### When to use conditional forms

#### If

If the sentence includes "jos", the word for "if". 

#### Politeness

If you are being particularly polite, and asking a question or making a
suggestion.

This also works for requests, "would you open the door?", which are not
commands.

#### Expressing a Wish

When stating something you want to happen, which hasn't happened.
