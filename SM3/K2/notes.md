## Passive

### Formation

#### With verb type 1

- Start with the body of the word, from the minä form
- Add taan/tään, depending on vowel harmonies.

#### With verb type 2

- Start with the infinitive (which should be ending with da/dä/la/lä/ta/tä)
- Add an/än, depending on vowel harmonies.

### Negative formation

To form the negative passive, simply start with the positive passive, remove the
final an/än, and place after "ei".

### Usage

The passive tense is used when;

#### No clear subject

If there's an object (like a table), place (like Finland) or a time (8AM, or
the summer of 1969) right before the verb.

Who is doing the action (the subject of the sentence) is not indicated. For
example; "In Finland, lots of cake is eaten." (Suomeksi: Suomessasyödaan paljon
kakkua).

### Spoken form of "we"

In spoken language, as a replacement for the `-mme` form. For example: "We eat
  in a restaurant."

Note that this *only works* if the word `me` appears before the verb in passive
form. So, in the example, this becomes; "Me syömään ravintolassa"

### In suggestions

It also works as a way of suggesting something, for example, "Let's go to a 
restaurant" is "mennän ravintolan".

## Passive Objects

If, in a normal sentence, the verb would be in genitive form, for example "oven"
in "Vahtimestari avaa koulun oven klo 8", then it is in nominative in passive
form, in this example, "koulun ovi avataan klo 8".

In all other forms, for example, plurals, personal pronouns and partitives, the
form remains unchanged between the "normal" and "passive" sentenves.
